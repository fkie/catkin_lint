=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<catkin_lint> checks package configurations for the B<catkin> build system of B<ROS>.
It runs a static analysis of the C<package.xml> and C<CMakeLists.txt> files in your package,
and it will detect and report a number of common problems.

All diagnosed problems come in one of three possible severities:

I<Errors> are severe enough to break the build and/or produce unintended side effects.
Usually, they violate the rules outlined in the B<catkin> manual.

I<Warnings> are potential errors which may indicate a bug in your package but may be justified
for reasons B<catkin_lint> cannot discern. Constructs which trigger a warning can usually
be modified in a way that is functionally equivalent but more robust.

I<Notices> are issues which are not objectionable from a technical view point but should be
addressed to improve the quality of the package. Many notices highlight violations of the
recommendations and best practises from the B<catkin> manual.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--config> I<FILE>

Read configuration settings from I<FILE>. This option can be used multiple times.
See L<CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT> for details.

=item B<--quiet>, B<-q>

Suppress all outputs expect for the detected problems, in particular, do not show
the summary at the end.

=item B<--no-quiet>

Show a summary of the findings at the end. This is the default setting.

=item B<--severity-level> I<LEVEL>, B<-W> I<LEVEL>

Choose the severity level for diagnostic output. Level 0 displays errors only,
level 1 displays errors and warnings, and level 2 displays everything. The default
setting is B<-W1>.

=item B<--notice> I<ID>, B<--warning> I<ID>, B<--error> I<ID>

Override the default severity of certain problems. See L<PROBLEM IDS> for details
on the available IDs.

=item B<--ignore> I<ID>

Ignore a problem. This is mostly useful to work around a known bug in B<catkin_lint>,
because problems tend to not go away if you ignore them. See L<PROBLEM IDS> for details
on the available IDs.

=item B<--show-ignored>

Show all problems you ignored. Use this if an ignored problem did not go away, but
you forgot which one.

=item B<--strict>

Treat any reported problem as a fatal error. Some people use the option to enforce
that warnings get fixed, too. You can also combine this with B<-W2>
to turn even notices into errors, if you are exceptionally pedantic and/or have a
high pain tolerance.

=item B<--no-strict>

This will undo the effects of your rash decision to put C<strict=yes> in your
configuration file. This is also the default setting.

=item B<--pkg> I<PKG>

Check the package I<PKG> for problems. The package must be in the B<ROS> package search
path.

=item B<--skip-pkg> I<PKG>

Skip the package I<PKG> when processing a package subtree. The package will not be linted,
but it will be treated as a known package for dependency resolutions.

=item B<--package-path> I<PATH>[:I<PATH>[...]]

Add one or more additional locations to the B<ROS> package search path. Separate multiple
locations with C<:>. B<catkin_lint> will use this path list and the B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH>
environment variable to resolve the B<--pkg> option and dependencies of linted packages.

=item B<--skip-path> I<MATCH>

Skip packages if their location contains I<MATCH>. No wildcards or pattern matching allowed,
only proper substrings are recognized.

=item B<--rosdistro> I<DISTRO>

Assume that all packages are supposed to work with the B<ROS> distribution I<DISTRO>. By default, this
value is taken from the B<ROS_DISTRO> environment variable. B<catkin_lint> will use this to
query the B<ROS> database for packages which are not locally installed.

=item B<--offline>

Forbid metadata queries to the B<ROS> package index. This will disable certain diagnostics which
rely on knowing details about all package dependencies. Metadata queries are not needed for
packages which can be found locally through the B<ROS> package search path.

=item B<--no-offline>

Allow metadata queries to the B<ROS> package index. This is the default.

=item B<--resolve-env>

Resolve environment variables B<$ENV{}> in CMake scripts. By default, B<catkin_lint> will treat
all environment variables like empty strings and issue a warning.

=item B<--no-resolve-env>

Do not resolve environment variables B<$ENV{}> in CMake scripts and issue a warning if they are
used. This is the default.

=item B<--output> I<FORMAT>

Select the output format for the diagnosed problems. Valid output formats are B<text>, B<explain>,
B<json>, and B<xml>. See L<OUTPUT FORMATS> for more details.

=item B<--text>, B<--explain>, B<--json>, B<--xml>

These are deprecated aliases for B<--output> I<FORMAT>.

=item B<--color> I<MODE>

Configure the colorization of the B<text> and B<explain> output formats. The default mode is B<auto>,
which will use ANSI colors if B<catkin_lint> detects a terminal as output. The modes B<always> and
B<never> will override the detection and output ANSI colors always or never, respectively.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT FORMATS

B<catkin_lint> supports a variety of output formats as argument for the B<--output> option:

=over

=item B<text>

This is the default format, which outputs a short, human-readable description of all problems.

=item B<explain>

This is an extended B<text> format, which will show an additional explanation when a problem type
occurs for the first time. It will also mention the message ID which you need to change the
severity or ignore a problem.

=item B<json>

Outputs all problems in JSON format.

=item B<xml>

Outputs all problems in XML format.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

B<catkin_lint> uses B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH> to find locally available packages and B<ROS_DISTRO> to 
determine the installed B<ROS> distribution when querying the B<ROS> package index or the B<rosdep> database.
All other environment variables will be ignored, unless B<catkin_lint> is instructed to resolve
them in CMake scripts by B<--resolve-env>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

=over

=item B<0>

All packages were linted successfully and no errors occurred.

=item B<1>

An error occurred.

=item B<66>

No packages found.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

B<catkin_lint> will look for configuration options in the following files:

=over 

=item *

Files explicitly specified using B<--config>

=item *

F<.catkin_lint> files in all locations from B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH>

=item *

F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/catkin_lint>

=item *

F<~/.config/catkin_lint> if B<XDG_CONFIG_HOME> is unset or empty

=item *

F<~/.catkin_lint>

=back

B<catkin_lint> will read all available configuration files and merge them into
a single configuration. Earlier entries in the above list will take precedence
if conflicting options are found. Command line arguments will override any
configuration file setting. Configuration files are in an INI-style format with
one or more sections in it.

=head2 [catkin_lint] section

The main section is called C<[catkin_lint]> and will take the following 
B<catkin_lint> specific options:

=over

=item B<color> = B<auto> E<verbar> B<never> E<verbar> B<always>

Determine output colorization mode. The default setting B<auto> will enable
colorization if and only if standard output is connected to terminal. The modes B<always>
and B<never> will override the detection and output ANSI colors always or never,
respectively.

=item B<offline> = B<no> E<verbar> B<yes>

Allow or forbid metadata queries to the B<ROS> package index. This will disable certain
diagnostics which rely on knowing details about all package dependencies. Metadata
queries are not needed for packages which can be found locally through the B<ROS>
package search path. The default setting is B<no>.

=item B<output> = B<text> E<verbar> B<explain> E<verbar> B<json> E<verbar> B<xml>

Select the output format for problem reports. See L<OUTPUT FORMATS> for details.
The default setting is B<text>.

=item B<package_path> = I<PATH>[:I<PATH>[...]]

Prepend the specified I<PATH>s to B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH> in order to find locally
available packages and/or package dependencies.

=item B<quiet> = B<no> E<verbar> B<yes>

Select output verbosity. The default setting B<no> allows B<catkin_lint> to print
some additional information to standard error, such as a final summary of all
detected problems.

=item B<resolve_env> = B<no> E<verbar> B<yes>

Allow or forbid resolution of environment variables. The default setting B<no>
lets B<catkin_lint> ignore environment variables and issue a warning whenever
a CMake command references the environment using B<$ENV{}>.

=item B<rosdistro> = I<DISTRO>

Assume that all packages are supposed to work with the B<ROS> distribution I<DISTRO>.
By default, this value is taken from the B<ROS_DISTRO> environment variable.
B<catkin_lint> will use this to query the B<ROS> database for packages which are not
locally installed.

=item B<severity_level> = B<0> E<verbar> B<1> E<verbar> B<2>

Choose the severity level for diagnostic output. Level 0 displays errors only,
level 1 displays errors and warnings, and level 2 displays everything. The default
setting is B<1>.

=item B<strict> = B<no> E<verbar> B<yes>

In strict mode, B<catkin_lint> will treat every reported problem as error and return
with exit code 1 (see L<RETURN VALUES>). By default, warnings and notices are
informational only. This setting is mostly interesting for automated test runs,
where the exit code is evaluated. Note that ignored problems and everything hidden
by the chosen B<severity_level> will not be considered failures.

=back

=head2 Package-specific severity overrides

All section names besides C<[catkin_lint]> are interpreted as package names and
will override the reported severities of problems. As a special case, the
section C<[*]> will apply to all packages. The overrides are specified in the
format C<ID = Severity>, where the severity can be one of
B<ignore>, B<error>, B<warning>, B<notice>, or B<default>. See L<PROBLEM IDS> for
details on the available IDs.

Unlike B<--strict>, this gives you very fine-grained control over which problems
are supposed to be fatal, so you are encouraged to integrate B<catkin_lint> into
your CI test pipeline and tune the settings in a way that fits your project.

=head1 PROBLEM IDS

You can run B<catkin_lint --help-problem> to get a list of all problem IDs, and
B<catkin_lint --help-problem I<ID>> for a more detailed explanation of each
problem.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Command line arguments

=over

=item B<catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src>

Check all packages in F<~/catkin_ws/src> for problems.

=item B<catkin_lint --pkg foo --pkg bar>

Check the packages C<foo> and C<bar> for problems, assuming that
they can be found in one of the locations listed in B<ROS_PACKAGE_PATH>.

=item B<catkin_lint --pkg foo --pkg bar --package-path ~/my_other_ws/src>

Check the packages C<foo> and C<bar> for problems when the
former assumption turned out to be false.

=item B<catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src --skip-path unstable>

Check all packages in F<~/catkin_ws/src>, but skip all packages in a path
that contains the string C<unstable>.

=item B<catkin_lint ~/catkin_ws/src --skip-pkg baz>

Check all packages except C<baz> in F<~/catkin_ws/src>.

=back

=head2 Configuration file

The following configuration file will instruct B<catkin_lint> to output its results
in JSON format, ignore any problems with unknown packages (except in the package foo),
and elevate the notice about unsorted lists to a warning for all packages (including foo):

    [catkin_lint]
    output = json
    quiet = yes

    [*]
    unknown_package = ignore
    unsorted_list = warning

    [foo]
    unknown_package = default
