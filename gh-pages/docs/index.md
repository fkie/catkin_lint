# catkin_lint

**catkin_lint** checks package configurations for the
[catkin](https://github.com/ros/catkin) build system of
[ROS](http://www.ros.org>). It runs a static analysis of the `package.xml`
and `CMakeLists.txt` files in your package, and it will detect and report a
number of common problems.

## Running

If **catkin_lint** is invoked with one or more paths as parameters, it
searches for packages recursively and checks all of them. For a more detailed
list of available command line arguments and configuration options, see
the [Usage section](usage.md) of this manual.

## Limitations

**catkin_lint** works by emulating the way CMake processes your package
during a build. However, since it does not _really_ build anything,
the emulation is not perfect. For instance,

- **catkin_lint** does not evaluate boolean expressions in `if()` clauses
  There is some special purpose code to detect `if(CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING)` blocks,
  but in general, **catkin_lint** will just execute all statements, even mutually exclusive
  `if()`/`else()` blocks.
- **catkin_lint** uses mock values for `find_package()`, `find_file()`, and `find_library()`
  calls. That means that those function calls will always succeed and "find" something.
- **catkin_lint** ignores `function()` definitions. It does, however, expand macros and
  `foreach()` loops.

## Diagnostic Levels

**catkin_lint** has [messages](messages.md) in three different categories:
errors, warnings, and notices. The `-W` option controls which problems
are reported to the user:

- `-W0`: only errors are reported
- `-W1`: errors and warnings are reported (this is the default)
- `-W2`: errors, warnings, and notices are reported

Normally, **catkin_lint** returns a non-zero exit code if and only
if errors occurred. The `--strict` option causes **catkin_lint** to
treat any reported problem as error. You can also customize the category
for particular diagnostics with `--error ID`, `--warning ID`, or
`--notice ID`. You can also ignore messages entirely with `--ignore ID`.

### Errors

Errors are severe enough to break the build and/or produce unintended
side effects. Usually, they violate the rules outlined in the
[catkin manual](http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/).

### Warnings

Potential errors which may indicate a bug in your package but may be
justified for reasons **catkin_lint** cannot discern. Constructs which
trigger a warning can usually be modified in a way that is functionally
equivalent but more robust.

### Notices

Issues which are not objectionable from a technical view point but
should  be addressed to improve the quality of the package. Many notices
highlight violations of the recommendations and best practises from the
catkin manual.

## CI Integration

**catkin_lint** is available as optional test feature in the
[ROS Industrial CI](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci) and
the [ROS MoveIt Continuous Integration](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ci)
scripts.
